                    <p>At re:learn, our goal is to help schools use technology in a smart way to enhance learning.
                        Through content curation and capacity development - with a wide network of trained facilitators,
                        our
                        aim is to improve the learning experience in and out of the classroom. </p>
                        <p> The re:learn Centre located in Abuja is a home of experimentation as we identify innovative ways
                        to
                        equip teachers and students with 21st century tools to accelerate the delivery of content and
                        ultimately studentsâ€™ learning.
